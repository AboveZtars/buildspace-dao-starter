# buildspace x thirdweb

### **Welcome ðŸ‘‹**
This is a simple Megaman DAO I did to encourage my friend Andres to get into web3.

To get started, clone this repo and follow these commands:

1. Run `yarn install` at the root of your directory
2. Run `yarn start` to start the project
3. Start coding!
